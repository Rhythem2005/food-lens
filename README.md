## 🤔 Why FoodLens?

Every food delivery app shows different prices.

You open:

✅ Zomato
✅ Swiggy
✅ MagicPin

...and spend 10 minutes comparing offers.

FoodLens AI does this automatically.

Simply type:

```text
Cheap paneer momos under ₹150
```

or

```text
Pizza for 4 people under ₹800
```

or

```text
Best biryani with fastest delivery
```

and FoodLens finds the best options instantly.
