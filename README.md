# 📌 Overview

FlavourFind is a real-time food comparison engine that searches multiple food delivery platforms simultaneously and recommends the best options.

Instead of opening multiple apps to compare prices, delivery times and ratings, FlavourFind performs the comparison automatically.

Search naturally like:

```text
Best pizza under ₹400

Healthy meal under ₹250

Biryani for 3 people under ₹700

Fastest burger delivery near me
```
